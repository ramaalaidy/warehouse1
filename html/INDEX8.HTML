    <h2 class="text">The Art Of Homemade Pizza</h2> 
   <p class="text2">
    Nothing beats the comforting aroma of freshly baked pizza.
     Crafting your own pizza at home lets you experiment with a 
     variety of toppings and crust styles. From a classic<span class="bold"> Margherita</span>
      to a hearty meat lover's delight, the possibilities are endless.
       Start with a perfectly kneaded dough, spread a rich tomatc sauce, 
       sprinkle mozzarella, and top with your favorite ingredients. Baking
        pizza in a hot oven ensures a crispy crust and gooey cheese, creating a
         culinary masterpiece that's both fun to make and delicious to eat.</p>
        <h2 class="text">A Symphony of Flavors: Mediterranean Salads</h2> 
        <p class="text2">
            Mediterranean salads are a celebration of fresh, healthy, and 
            vibrant ingredients. A classic option like the <span class="bold">greek salad </span>combines crisp
             cucumbers, juicy tomatoes, and tangy feta cheese, drizzled with olive oil
              and sprinkled with oregano. Add a handful of olives for an authentic touch.
               Another favorite is the TABBOULEH, a parsley-based salad with bulgur wheat, mint, and lemon juice. These salads are perfect as a light meal or a flavorful side dish,
             embodying the simplicity and richness of Mediterranean cuisine.</p>
